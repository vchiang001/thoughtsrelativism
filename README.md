# Thoughts Relativism: My contemplative journey inspired by grandma 
思維相對論 - 奶奶啟發我踏上的思想旅程 (Han Sinitic Language) ISBN: 978-0-473-67572-1 My grandmother's deep spirituality fostered a contemplative life, a quality that was profoundly embodied in our weekly video chats. Ever since I moved out of New Zealand, we maintained this ritual, spending 1-2 hours each week for nearly a decade in thoughtful conversation. Our discussions included quick Q&A sessions, offering opportunities for sharing stories and perspectives. These exchanges were pivotal in shaping my own journey of contemplation. This book delves into these experiences, using a diverse range of content to stimulate thought exploration through excerpts and questions.
